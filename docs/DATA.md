## Dataset Preparation

### NuScenes

+ Download the dataset from the [download page](https://www.nuscenes.org/download)
+ Extract the downloaded files and make sure you have the following structure:
  ```
  [Parent Folder]
    samples	-	Sensor data for keyframes.
    sweeps	-	Sensor data for intermediate frames.
    maps	        -	Folder for all map files: rasterized .png images and vectorized .json files.
    v1.0-*	-	JSON tables that include all the meta data and annotations. Each split (trainval, test, mini) is provided in a separate folder.
  ```
>Note: We use the **train_track** split to train our model and test it with the **val** split. Both splits are officially provided by NuScenes. During testing, we ignore the sequences where there is no point in the first given bbox. Besides, we do not recommend using preload due to the need to extract trajectory data.
